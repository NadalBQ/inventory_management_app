# My first attempt at making a web app
My personal inventory management app, designed for the tracking of inputs and outputs on my private storage room.

You can take a look at it through this [link](https://inventory-management-app-6jlp.onrender.com/)! It may take a while to load in :/ as it is being hosted on a free RENDER account.

In order to change the database, you must provide a valid GitHub token.

The app in this repo is deployed at [https://flask.onrender.com](https://flask.onrender.com).

## Deployment

If you want to deploy your own web app:
Follow the guide at https://render.com/docs/deploy-flask.
